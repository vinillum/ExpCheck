# ExpCheck
BGG Expansion Checker

It uses simple JSON formatted data to store the history of seen expansions.
The expansions themselves will be shown in your default browser.

Note: I couldn't find a way to retrieve a list of accesories a user owns, so when running the tool you will see all of
the accesories you already own, unfortunately.
